# Demo Plugin

This plugin provides a structure for most of my plugins:



To start a new plugin:

- copy this dir
- set git remote:  git remote set-url xxx xxxx
- Change the pluginConfig
- Change all the `demo`s to this plugin name
    - in demo.svelte:  demo_main.js and demo.less in the style part
    - change `@name  : windy-plugin-demo;` in global.less and demo.less 
- Make the screenshot.jpg in src
- Write the README.me
- I think that is about it,  start building!!!
